    How I became a Azure Developer
</h2>

This recent previous year 2023, finally I got my certification as Azure Developer. I desired so much this certification and it was not easy for me to get it, for tha reason I would like to give some recommendations that I helped me with this certification.

Some resources that helped me.

* [__Microsoft Learn__](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-204/)

Microsoft Learn is a powerful platform to learn about Microsoft Technologies and this obviously because they teach about their own products. I considered before that this platform was not so helpful, but I gave it the chance and it honestly surprised me because helped me a lot to understand some concepts that I didn't handle properly.

Give it the opportunity!

* [__Udemy Course By Scott Duffy__](https://www.udemy.com/course/70532-azure/)

This course helped me at the beginning, when my knowledge was not so deeper and this course is not theory on the contary is more practical. the professor explain you each point that this exam evaluate.

I recommend you to take advantage of the offers that Udemy provides, and this time January 27th 2024 this course costs 13.99 USD.

* [__Exam Topics__](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/az-204/view/)

Exam Topics it is a platform that has a bank of question of past question about this exam. I recommend you this platform for practice and give you an idea of what the exam will be like.

This past 3 resources were what I used.

__Information about the exam__

* I recommend you to schedule this exam with 1 month in advance, I consider that 1 month is enough to prepare for the exam.

* The price for this exam is variable among different countries, for example for my country Costa Rica, the price is 100 USD and for the USA the price is 160 USD.

* For practice you will need an Azure Suscription, if it is your first time with an Azure Suscription you will get 200 USD of credit to spend in Azure. 

* I recommend you when you are practicing with any Azure Service, delete the service when you finish your practice, because depends of the service, the service will consume per usage and you will have to pay the cost of the service for that usage.

I encourage you to take this certification exam, it will help you with your professional career.

This is my certificate.
